# Ghost Chess / Mystical Chess

## Description

For this game, my main idea is to push out a game and increase my skills in game developing. \
I want to reinvent the famous old game chess. My idea is to limit the players range from what their pieces can see. \
This makes for a harder game by making it harder for the player to see what his enemy is doing.
