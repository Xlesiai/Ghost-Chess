# Ghost Chess
 This is a personal project. This is an idea that I had where the player can only see some in front of its chess pieces. I have not implemented this idea yet but I believe its a good starter game to make since it will help me with multiplayer, UI, and game mechanics. I also want to create this in Unreal to dip my toes into the C# coding and API's that Unreal has.

# Update 
I realized that i havent updated my readme. . . 
so that happened \
anyways \
I've created a pho enviroment to test out the game using free assets in the unity store.
- [Dark Fantacy Kit [Lite]](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/dark-fantasy-kit-lite-127925)
- [Tiny Chess - Stone Chess Piece](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/tiny-chess-stone-chess-piece-112537)

# Environment
This is a testing environment, inspired by the [Dark Fantacy Kit [Lite]](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/dark-fantasy-kit-lite-127925) and [Tiny Chess - Stone Chess Piece](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/tiny-chess-stone-chess-piece-112537), I've created an old medieval bedroom.
