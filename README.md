# Ghost Chess
 This is a personal project. This is an idea that I had where the player can only see some in front of its chess pieces. I have not implemented this idea yet but I believe its a good starter game to make since it will help me with multiplayer, UI, and game mechanics. I also want to create this in Unreal to dip my toes into the C# coding and API's that Unreal has.
